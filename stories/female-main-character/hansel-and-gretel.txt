{name} and {friend}
Once upon a time, there were two children called {name} and {friend}. They lived in a small cottage at the edge of the forest with their father, a poor woodcutter, and their stepmother.
One evening, the family had nothing left to eat but a few crusts of bread. {name} and {friend} went to bed hungry. As they lay in their beds, they heard their parents talking.
"There are too many mouths to feed," said their stepmother. "We must take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there."
"Never!" cried their father.
But the next morning, {name} and {friend}'s stepmother woke them early.
"Get up!" she ordered. "We're going into the forest to chop wood."
She handed them each a crust of bread for their lunch.
With a heavy heart, the woodcutter led his children into the forest. As they walked along, {name} secretly dropped a trail of breadcrumbs along the path.
When they reached the middle of the forest, the woodcutter said, "Wait here. We'll return at sunset."
{name} and {friend} waited all day, but their father and stepmother didn't come back. Soon, it was dark among the thick trees and {friend} was frightened.
"Don't worry," said {name}, cuddling her sister. "We'll follow the trail of breadcrumbs I dorpped along the path. They will lead us home."
But when the moon came up, they couldn't see any crumbs.
"Oh, no! The birds must have eaten them all!" whispered {name}.
{name} and {friend} curled up under a tree and fell fast asleep.
The next morning, they wandered through the forest until they came to a little cottage made of gingerbread and sweets.
The children were so hungry they picked sweets off the house and crammed them into their mouths. The {food}s were {name}'s favourites.
Just then, the door opened and an old woman hobbled out.
"Come in children," she said, smiling. "I've got plenty more food in here."
The old woman fed them well and then put them to bed. But {name} and {friend} didn't know that the old woman was actually a wicked witch who liked to eat children!
When {name} and {friend} woke up, the witch grabbed {name} and locked her in a cage. She set {friend} to work cooking huge meals to fatten up {name}.
The weeks went by and every morning the witch went up to the cage, asking {name} to hold out her finger. 
"I want to feel if you are fat enough to eat," she said.
{name}, being a smart girl, held out an old chicken bone instead. The witch's eyesight was so bad she thought the won was {name}'s finger.
One day, the witch got tired of waiting for the girl to get fatter and decided to cook her right away.
Grabbing {friend}'s arm, she said, "Go and check if the oven is hot enough.2 And she pushed {friend} towards the open oven door. Grinning horribly, she licked her cracked lips. she was planning to eat {friend} too, and couldn't wait for ther delicious meal.
"I'm too bit to fit in there," said {friend}, guessing the witch's wicked plan.
"You silly girl," cackled the witch. "Even I could fit in there." And she stuck her head inside. With a great bit shove, {friend} pushed the witch into the oven and slammed the door shut.
"{name}, the witch is dead!" cried {friend}, unlocking her sister's cage.
As the children made thier way out of the house, they found chests crammed with gold and sparkling jewels. They filled their pockets and set off home.
Their father was overjoyed to see them. He told them that their stepmother had died while they were gone so they had nothing to fear any more. {name} and {friend} showed thier father the treasures.
"We will never go hungry again!" he cried.
And they all lived happily ever after.
