The Three Little Pigs
Once upon a time, three little pigs, {name}, {friend} and Tom lived together with their mother. One day it was time for them to leave home and build hoses of their own.
"Be careful of the big, bad wold," warned their mother as they trotted off down the road.
The first little pig, {name} built her hous from straw.
Before long the big, bad wolf came to call.
"Little pig, little pig, let me come in," growled the wolf, licking his lips. He had come for his supper.
"Not by the hairs of my chinny-chin-chin!" the first little pig {name} replied.
"Well, I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" snarled the wold. And that's just what he did. The little pig ran away as fast as she could.
The second little pig, {friend} decided to build her house form sticks.
When the woolf saw the house, he pushed his nose against the door and growled, "Little pig, little pig, let me come in."
"Not by the hairs of my chinny-chin-chin!" cried the second little pig.
"Well, I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" snarled the wolf. And that's just what he did. The little pig ran away as fast as she could.
The third little pig, Tom built a strong house from bricks. He had just put a pot of soup on the fire to boil when he saw his sisters running down the pats, closely followed by the wolf. 
"Quick!" cried the third little pig. He opened the door and let his sisters inside.
"Little pigs, little pigs, let me come in!" roared the wolf. 
"Not by the hairs on our chinny-chin-chins," cried the three little pigs.
"Well, I'll huff and I'll puff and I'll blow your house down!" snarled the wolf. So he huffed and he puffed... And he huffed and he puffed... But the house stood firm.
The wolf climbed onto the roof and slid down the chimney - straight into the pot of hot soup.
"Owwwoooo!" he cried. 
The wolf leaped up and ran out of the house, never to be seen again.
