Captain {name}'s New Rules
Captain {name} loved being a pirate... mostly.
"I just wich there weren't so many rules," he grumbled, thumping the Pirate Rulebook. He didn't seem to be allowed to do any of the things he really wanted.
"I'd realy lika a pet {animal}," Captain {name} said one day.
"Pirates don't have {animal}s," said his first mate {friend}, looking astonished. "A parrot is the only pet for a pirate captain. Look in the rulebook."
"My feet ache," said Captain {name} another day. "I think I'll get myself a nice, comfy pair of slippers.
"Pirates don't wear slippers!" said the first mate {friend} in a shocked voice. "They wear stiff leather boots. It's rule number five."
"But leather boots give me blisters," Captain {name} grumbled.
One sunny afternoon, Captain {name} looked down through the clear water and saw a dozen of oyster shells on the seabed.
"Let's dive for pearls!" he cried.
"Pirates don't dive for pearls," said the first mate {friend} with a gasp. "We're supposed to rob them from other ships. Do you know the Pirate Rulebook at all?"
Captain {name} flung the rulebook down on the deck and jumped up and down on it. 
"I'm tired of being told what pirates don't do!" he roared. "From now on, I'm going to decide on the rules!"
At first, the crew were worried. What if other pirates laughed at them? But after a while, they started to enjoy themselves. After all, sheepskin slippers were a lot cosier than leather boots. The Captain's {animal} dog knew some good tricks, and they found more pearls by diving for them than by robbing ships.
"This is the life for me!" exclaimed Captain {name}, wiggling his toes in his new slippers.
Soon, every pirate on the high seas had heard about Captain {name}'s new rules, and can you guess what? They all wanted to join his crew!
