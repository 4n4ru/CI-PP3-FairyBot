{name}
There was once a carpenter called Geppetto. One day, he was walking through an enchanted forest when he heard a voice coming from a magic piece of wood. 
Geppetto took the wood home an carved a little pupet boy from it. He gave the boy a suit of clothes and a hat with a feather in it.
The wooden oy danced an talked.
Geppetto named the boy {name}.
"You must go to school like other children," Geppetto told him. 
So the next morning, with some coins in his pocket to buy lunch, {name} went to school.
Along the way, a cricket named {friend} hopped up onto his shoulder. 
"You look like you could use a friend," he told {name}. "I will help you learn right from worng."
Further down the road, {name} met a fox and a cat. They had heard his money jangling in his pocket.
"Come and play with us!" said the fox slyly.
"{name}, you promised your father you would go to school," the cricket {friend} whispered.
But {name}, not knowing any better, followed the cat and the fox into a dark forest.
"Plant your money here, and it will grow into a money tree," they told {name}. "Just come back tomorrow, and you'll see."
The next morning, instead of going to school, {name} went to find his money tree. But when he reached the spot where he'd buried his coins, there was no money tree, and his coins had gone.
"They played a trick on you," sighed his friend {friend}, the cricket. "They just wanted to get your money."
{name} felt silly, but he pretended he didn't care, and stomped off into the forest. The little cricket {friend} begged him to go back to Geppetto, but {name} wouldn't listen. Just as it was getting dark, they came to a tiny cottage. {name} knocked on the door loudly and a pretty fairy answered.
"We're lost," explained {name}. "Please can you help us?"
The {color} fairy invited them in and gave them some food.
"Why are you so far from home?" she asked kindly.
{name} didn't want to tell her that he had disobeyed his father.
"I was chased by a giant!" he lied.
Suddenly, {name}'s nose grew a little.
"And I ran into the forest to escape!" he continued. And {name}'s nose grew again!
"I have put a spell on you!" said the {color} fairy. "Every time you tell a lie, your wooden nose will grow."
{name} began to cry. "I won't tell any more lies," he promised.
The {color} fairy waved her wand and {name}'s nose returned to normal.
"From now on I will do just as Father tells me," he said.
But when he returned home, Geppetto wasn't there. He was out searching for {name}!
"We must find Father and bring him home," he sobbed, feeling bad. 
They bedan their search by the river. But when they got there, {name} fell into the water. The cricked {friend} jumped in to help him, but an enormous fish swallowed them both.
There in the fish's tummy, they found Geppetto! He had been swallowed by the fish too. 
{name} hugged his father tightly. "I won't leave you again!" he said.
Then {name} took the feather from his hat and tickled the fish.
"A... a... a... choo!" The fish gave a mighty sneeze and Geppetto, {name} and the cricket {friend} flew out of the fish's mouth, and landed on the riverbank.
That night, as {name} slept in his own little bed, the kind {color} fairy flew in through his window.
"You're a good, brave boy," she said, and she kissed him on the forehead.
When {name} awoke the next morning, he found that he was no longer made from wood. He was a real boy! From then on he was always a good son to Geppetto, and the best of friends with the cricket {friend}, who didn't need to tell him right from wrong ever again.
