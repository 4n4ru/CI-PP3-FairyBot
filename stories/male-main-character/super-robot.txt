Super Robot
{name} and {friend} were friends. They both liked {sport}, they both disliked {disliked-food}, and they both loved robots.
But they supported different {sport} teams. They tried to sneak {dislike-food} onto each other's plates at dinner time. And they each wanted to win their town's Build A Robot competition.
{name} and {firend} worked hard to make their robots and dreamed of beating each other. On the day of the competition asked them what their robots did. "Mine's super strong," said {name}. "It can lift anything!"
"Mine's super fast," said {friend}, pushing {name} to the side. "It's quicker than a jet!"
Just then the organiser got a phone call. "Bad news," she said. "The judge's car has broken down miles away. I'll havre to cancel the competition!"
{name} and {friend} looked at each other. If they put their robots together, they could rescue the judge and save the competition. But could they forget their differences?
The friends hammered, welded and twiddled until they had built one giant super robot. Then they opened the control panel and tappped in their instructions. BEEP BEEP! The robot nodded and then ZOOM! it was gone!
The crowd held their breath as it sped out of sight. Could it rescue the judge? Then the robot reappeared, carrying the judge's car above it's head. It put the car down and the judge stepped out. 
"Who made this amazing robot?" he asked, smiling.
{name} and {friend} stepped forward, arm in arm.
"What great teamwork," said the judge. "You are the joint winners of the competition!"
{name} and {friend} grinned at each other. Winning was wonderful, but the best part was working as a team!
