""I never want to see gold again,"" sobbed king David and he wished with all his heart for things to be back to normal.
Luckily the blue fairy, who had been watchin all along, took pity on him. Everything changed back to the way it had been before, and king David had learned a valueable lesson. He hugged his best friend Roko and was happy everything was back to normal again.

i6etPRJ,"Laura and Sophie
Once upon a time, there were two children called Laura and Sophie. They lived in a small cottage at the edge of the forest with their father, a poor woodcutter, and their stepmother.
One evening, the family had nothing left to eat but a few crusts of bread. Laura and Sophie went to bed hungry. As they lay in their beds, they heard their parents talking.
""There are too many mouths to feed,"" said their stepmother. ""We must take the children into the thickest part of the forest and leave them there.""
""Never!"" cried their father.
But the next morning, Laura and Sophie's stepmother woke them early.
""Get up!"" she ordered. ""We're going into the forest to chop wood.""
She handed them each a crust of bread for their lunch.
With a heavy heart, the woodcutter led his children into the forest. As they walked along, Laura secretly dropped a trail of breadcrumbs along the path.
When they reached the middle of the forest, the woodcutter said, ""Wait here. We'll return at sunset.""
Laura and Sophie waited all day, but their father and stepmother didn't come back. Soon, it was dark among the thick trees and Sophie was frightened.
""Don't worry,"" said Laura, cuddling her sister. ""We'll follow the trail of breadcrumbs I dorpped along the path. They will lead us home.""
But when the moon came up, they couldn't see any crumbs.
""Oh, no! The birds must have eaten them all!"" whispered Laura.
Laura and Sophie curled up under a tree and fell fast asleep.
The next morning, they wandered through the forest until they came to a little cottage made of gingerbread and sweets.
The children were so hungry they picked sweets off the house and crammed them into their mouths. The chocolates were Laura's favourites.
Just then, the door opened and an old woman hobbled out.
""Come in children,"" she said, smiling. ""I've got plenty more food in here.""
The old woman fed them well and then put them to bed. But Laura and Sophie didn't know that the old woman was actually a wicked witch who liked to eat children!
When Laura and Sophie woke up, the witch grabbed Laura and locked her in a cage. She set Sophie to work cooking huge meals to fatten up Laura.
The weeks went by and every morning the witch went up to the cage, asking Laura to hold out her finger. 
""I want to feel if you are fat enough to eat,"" she said.
Laura, being a smart girl, held out an old chicken bone instead. The witch's eyesight was so bad she thought the won was Laura's finger.
One day, the witch got tired of waiting for the girl to get fatter and decided to cook her right away.
Grabbing Sophie's arm, she said, ""Go and check if the oven is hot enough.2 And she pushed Sophie towards the open oven door. Grinning horribly, she licked her cracked lips. she was planning to eat Sophie too, and couldn't wait for ther delicious meal.
""I'm too bit to fit in there,"" said Sophie, guessing the witch's wicked plan.
""You silly girl,"" cackled the witch. ""Even I could fit in there."" And she stuck her head inside. With a great bit shove, Sophie pushed the witch into the oven and slammed the door shut.
""Laura, the witch is dead!"" cried Sophie, unlocking her sister's cage.
As the children made thier way out of the house, they found chests crammed with gold and sparkling jewels. They filled their pockets and set off home.
Their father was overjoyed to see them. He told them that their stepmother had died while they were gone so they had nothing to fear any more. Laura and Sophie showed thier father the treasures.
""We will never go hungry again!"" he cried.
And they all lived happily ever after."
