The Golden Goose
There was once a poor boy called {name}, who lived with his family at the edge og a forest. One day when he was cutting wood, an old man approached him.
"Could I please share some of your food?" the man asked.
"Of course," said {name}, although he barely had enough food for himself.
"Thank you," said the old man. "You shall be rewarded. Cut down that tree over there and see what's inside it."
So he did. Hidden inside the tree trunk was a goose with golden feathers! Puzzled, {name} looked around for the old man, but he had mysteriously vanished.
It was getting too dark to walk home, so {name} picked up the goose and took it with him to an inn.
The inn-keeper's three daughters were fascinated by the goose's golden feathers. But when the eldest girl tried to take one, she stuck fast to the goose. As her sisters tried to pull her away, they all got stuck to each other.
The next morning, {name} set off down the street with the golden goose, dragging the girls behind him. 
When other pople saw the strange scene, they tried to pull the girls freem only to become stuck too!
Meanwhile, the kind had a daughter who never laughed. The king was so desperate to cheer her up that he had promised her hand in marriage to anyone who could make her happy. 
When the princess looked out of her palace window that day, she saw {name} walking along the street carrying a golden goose with a line of people staggering behind. The princess laughed and laughed. 
The king was delighted. "You made the princess laugh!" he told {name}. "That means you may marry her!"
"Me?! {name} cried, just as the goose jumped from his arms. All the people toppled backwads, unstuck, and the princess laughed again.
So {name} and the princess soon married, and they lived long, happy lives full of laughter.
